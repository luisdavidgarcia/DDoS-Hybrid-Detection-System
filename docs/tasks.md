**Task List: Network Traffic Analysis System**

I. **Data Collection and Preparation**

1. Gather relevant datasets (e.g., CSE-CIC-2017, NATR-2018, ISCX-2017)
2. Preprocess the data (e.g., normalize, anonymize, convert to suitable format)
3. Split the data into training, validation, and testing sets

II. **Autoencoder Training**

1. Design and implement an autoencoder architecture for feature extraction
2. Train the autoencoder on the prepared data
3. Evaluate the autoencoder's performance using metrics (e.g., accuracy, precision, recall)

III. **XGBoost Model Training**

1. Prepare the labeled dataset for XGBoost training
2. Design and implement an XGBoost model architecture for classification
3. Train the XGBoost model on the prepared data
4. Evaluate the XGBoost model's performance using metrics (e.g., accuracy, precision, recall)

IV. **System Integration**

1. Integrate the autoencoder and XGBoost models into a single system
2. Implement a workflow for anomaly detection and classification
3. Define rules for flagging potential attacks and triggering alerts

V. **Testing and Evaluation**

1. Test the system using various scenarios (e.g., normal traffic, simulated attacks)
2. Evaluate the system's performance using metrics (e.g., accuracy, precision, recall)
3. Refine the system as needed based on evaluation results

VI. **Visualization and Dashboarding**

1. Design a user-friendly dashboard for visualizing system outputs
2. Integrate the dashboard with the system for real-time monitoring
3. Provide alerts and notifications based on system detection

VII. **Deployment and Maintenance**

1. Deploy the system in a production environment (e.g., cloud, on-premises)
2. Monitor the system's performance and adjust as needed
3. Perform regular updates to ensure the system remains effective against emerging threats
